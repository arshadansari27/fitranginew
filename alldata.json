Depending upon the organizers you choose the 16 km stretch could be divided. The first 7 km can be taken by non-swimmers too because one needs to strictly stick to guidelines by the instructors.  There is a reason why this river is said to be the best for extreme kayakers. It has got I \u2013 IV grade rapids. One should also be aware of the chilling water since it descends from Himalayas. Even the beginners can have a good time around this river but just have to be cautious with the river since it can be furious at certain spots.

Many historical events took place here.</p><h3>It is a very tall fort and its huge size covers a diameter of almost 24 miles at its base. It is believed that only wind can roam around and water can pass through the thick forest surrounding the fort. Else, it is very difficult for anybody to pass through the thick jungles. This is the reason it was an unconquerable fort in Hindavi Swarajya. The structure of this fort gives us an insight to Shivaji Maharaj\u2019s sense of high-class architecture.</h3><h3>Location  </h3><p>Rajgad fort is 42\u00a0km to the south west of Pune, about 15\u201316\u00a0km west ofNasrapur, in theSahyadrisrange. The different ways of reaching Rajgad are as follows:</p><p>From Pune, you have to go Vajeghar village by bus, which is a journey of about 2 hours. From Vajeghar you will reach village Pali in about 10-15 minutes. From Pali, you have to walk for about 2-3 hours to reach to the top by Pali Darwaja. This is the easiest but the longest route to Rajgad.</p><p>Rajgad can also be approached from village by Gunjavane Darwaja or Chor Darwaja which will take you to the Padmavati machi.</p><h3>Sightseeing  </h3><h3>Padmavati lakeis very beautifully constructed. The walls of the lake are intact even today. An arch has been constructed from the continuation of the same wall to mark an entry to the lake.Padmavati devi Temple and  Rameshwar Temple attract many devotees. You can see a Shivalinga and an idol of Lord Hanuman in the Rameshwar Temple. You can also view the remains of the Rajwada castle.</h3><p>You can reach Pali Darwaja by climbing the stairs from the\u00a0Pali village. Pali darwaja is quite huge as even an elephant can enter through it. Gunjavane door is a series of three doors. The first door is simple one with strong fortified places on either side. The second door has a beautifully carved arch. At the third door, you can see carvings of two trunks of the elephants holding pots upside down.</p><p>Padmavati machi, which was not only a military base but also a residential zone, has the remains of temple of goddess Padmavati, tomb of Saibai, castel of constables, Padmavati Lake, secret doorway, Pali doorway, Gunjavane darwaja, storage yard of arms and ammunition on it. Alu darwaja Sanjivini Machi Suvela Machi and Citadel of Rajgad are the other interesting places to visit. With its sky-touching height and wide spread area, Rajgad fort offers the tourists and trekkers, a breathtaking view of the beautiful natural surroundings!</p><p></p><h3>Precaution </h3><p>There are many poisonous snakes in the thick forest surrounding the fort.</p><p></p><h3>Notes  </h3><p>Avoid going in summer.
