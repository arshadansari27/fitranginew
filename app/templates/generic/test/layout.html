        <div class="well">Well, that's it for now Jim.</div>
        <div class="well">A big design trend for 2013 is "flat" design. Gone are the days of excessive
                gradients and shadows. Designers are producing cleaner flat designs, and
                Bootstrap 3 takes advantage of this minimalist trend.

              The new fluid grid comes in 3 flavors, or actually sizes. The large grid <code>col-lg-*</code> works exactly like the Bootstrap 2.x <code>span*</code> did.
              There is also a small grid that is realized using the <code>col-sm-*</code> classes. This smaller grid is ideal for smartphones and tablets. 
              Finally, there is the non-stacking tiny grid <code>col-*</code> that is intended for very small screens less that 480px.
